Aadi - Create bump graph twice - one with small angle, one with big angle
Shaan - Add second cone system to sim
After - Add Companies

2 Companies always transmitting, everyone receives

Add more than 2 Companies
Get rid of flip flop 
Preprocessing to get rid of useless sats - find interferences both ways and compare

Increase number of satellites in both
Increase number of satellites in just one while keeping the other the same - go from below to above

1/25/23
Different companies (result)
Increase number of satellites in both
Increase number of satellites in just one while keeping the other the same - go from below to above
if we can: try having the satellites having angled beams instead of straight down beams

2/22/23
multiple compnaies - 6 line graph from increasing total number of sats
golden point of successes - try to find patterns

3/8/23
Fewer satellites would mean wider angle (what graphs are implying)
Flip graph below (make angles increasing x-axis and number of satellites as legend)
Company sweet spot graph using old code that separates companies into one

get companybump working
look at aadi's graph
get big program that calculates the optimal angle for a bunch of scenarios and graphs it.
Compare this to the equation we derived.
